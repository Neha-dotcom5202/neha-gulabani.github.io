## Learning points and thoughts on this endeavour

I have learnt alot of things while making this website. It has especially taught me to have patience when it comes to developing something. It has also showed me that
web development involves alot of time and effort. I like developing apps and websites. This technical task gave me an opportunity to test my skills. I hope to improve
much more in web development from time to time.
